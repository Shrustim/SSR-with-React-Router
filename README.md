## Demo of adding dynamic metadata tags server side with Create React App

To try the demo, first clone this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/justswim/cra-metatag-demo.git
cd cra-metatag-demo
npm install
npm run build
node server.js
```

Then visit `localhost:5000` in the browser. Try it in an incognito window if it is not working for you in your normal browser. 

You will be able to see the server render each route, and also if you view source, you will see the metatags dynamically generated by the server.
